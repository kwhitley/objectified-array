## Changelog
Until this library makes it to a production release of v1.x, **minor versions may contain breaking changes to the API**.  After v1.x, semantic versioning will be honored, and breaking changes will only occur under the umbrella of a major version bump.

- **v0.3.0** - shallow groups now require Boolean(true), Boolean(false) ignored, all else as subgroups
- **v0.2.0** - changed API to embed groups into root for better readability of group lookups
